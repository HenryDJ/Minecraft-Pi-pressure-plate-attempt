# Minecraft-Pi-pressure-plate-attempt

Here is an attempt to make a Minecraft Pi pressure plate.

Place a Nether Reactor Core down and step on it.
It will turn to glowing obsidian.
When you step off the pressure plate it will turn back to a Nether Reactor Core.

I have attempted to make a redstone wire which can be activated by the pressure plate, but it will only work if you have already stepped on the redstone and are at most one block away from it.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to get it working far away from the player?
